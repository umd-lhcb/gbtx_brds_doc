# GBTx boards documentation [![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/gbtx_brds_doc.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/gbtx_brds_doc)
An effort to record GBTx board setups at UMD LHCb group. We also include all
configuration files used for GBT DB/DCB testing.

## Build
This project utilizes the Travis CI to build and release new pdf files on new tags.
Alternatively, one can clone/download this repository and build pdf files locally with:
```
cp ./ci/post-xxx-sample.txt ./.git/hooks/post-checkout
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/post-checkout
git checkout  # this is to generate required version info
make all
```
note that prior to the build, LaTeX package dependencies need to be installed.

## Configuration files
Below we list usage of some of the configuration files.

* `master.txt`: For DCB master GBTx. We have enabled watchdog and timeout.
* `slave-Tx.txt`: For DCB data GBTxs. We terminate all E-groups with `0x11`.
* `slave-Tx-wrong_termination.txt`: For DCB data GBTxs. We terminate with `0xff`.
* `slave-Tx-reduced_egroups.txt`: For DCB data GBTxs. Only E-group 0-4 are enabled.
